> A generator to get your project up and running as quick as possible

generator-starter-files is a Yeoman generator that will generate the following files for you: .gitattributes, .editorconfig, and .gitignore. This was created for the main purpose of running it alongside by other generators, but feel free to use it as you please!

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-starter-files using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-starter-files
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo starter-files
```
